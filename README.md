#Is China hiding the true extent of infection across the country?  
Since the **Zero Covid** policy was lifted December 2022, Covid infections and deaths have spiked across China, but official data on the scope of the pandemic is very limited. In this document, I discuss two articles about whether China is hiding the true extent of infection across the country.  

## Article 1  
In BBC’s [China Covid: How many cases and deaths are there?]( https://www.bbc.com/news/59882774), the epidemic in China is at an unprecedented level since the fully lockdown was cancelled in China. However, there is very limited reporting of data on COVID cases and deaths in China. Hospitals and funeral parlours are more crowded and busier than ever before, according to BBC News, 
>“a study by Peking University estimated that as of 11 January, some 64% of the population were reported to be infected with the virus.” 

WHO believes that the data provided by China is still inaccurate and unreliable. The reason is that China uses its own criteria for deaths from COVID_19 and only records COVID infections in people with obvious symptoms in hospitals. Positive results from home test kits were not recorded in the data. Dr Louise Blair says that, 
> "These numbers imply a much lower number of deaths per capita in China than all other major countries have experienced.”  



## Article 2  
In Zhou’s [Five things Australia has wrong on China and COVID-19]( https://www.afr.com/world/asia/five-big-things-the-world-has-wrong-on-china-and-covid-19-20230103-p5ca0r), Zhou discussed the misconceptions that the world have about China regarding the epidemic, including the subject of my discussion: Whether China is hiding the number of COVID-19 cases. Zhou said that China is open and transparent about COVID-19 information and is not hiding anything. In response to questions from WHO and the rest of the world, Zhou argued that, 
>“China stopped conducting nucleic acid testing for all residents, which makes it difficult to know accurately what the case number is.”

In my opinion, Zhou's argument can explain part of the reason why China's reported data does not meet international expectations. But the huge data discrepancy makes me think that China is making excuses for underreporting the data.
